# Picky Prototype

A prototype for the Picky website.

## Tech Stack

The site is build with [SvelteKit][sveltekit], using the following tools:

- [tRPC][trpc] for frontend/backend communication
- [Prisma][prisma] on top of [PostgreSQL][psql] for data storage
- [Flowbite][flowbite]/[Tailwind][tailwind] for UI styling

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Further details to come soon!
